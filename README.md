Things I learned or practiced in this project:

- Importing Google fonts instead of using the regular sans-seriff font.
- Wrapping the label element around the input element to correcly assign the label to the corresponding input field.
- Using placeholder text as a default instead of an empty input field.
- Used the select element for the first time to get the user to select their occupation.
- Used radio buttons to try a different method of collecting information and asked the user if they would recommend Nando's to a friend.
- Used a checkbox input so that users can select multiple choices at the same time instead of the usual one choice at a time. 
- Used a textarea element to gather any further information the user wants to add.
